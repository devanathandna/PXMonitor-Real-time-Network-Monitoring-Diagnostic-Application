## üöÄ Getting Started (The Technical Bit)

For those comfortable with a bit of setup, here‚Äôs how to get PXMonitor running on your computer.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: A runtime for JavaScript.
- **Npcap**: A tool that lets PXMonitor see network traffic. You'll need to install this from the [official Npcap website](https://npcap.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devanathandna/PXMonitor-Real-time-Network-Monitoring-Diagnostic-Application
    cd pxmonitor
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:**
    ```bash
    # Install the main app's components
    npm install

    # Install the backend server's components
    cd backend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Add your Google Gemini API Key:**
    The AI features require a key from Google. You'll need to add gemini_model key to two files:
    

    In both files, find the line `const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";` and paste your key inside the quotes.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    You'll need to open two command-line terminals.

    - **Terminal 1: Start the Backend**
      ```bash
      cd backend
      node index.js
      ```

    - **Terminal 2: Start the Main App**
